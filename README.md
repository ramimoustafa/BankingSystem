This solution is developed using domain driven design architecture and the unit of work concept in repository pattern. 
The solution is segregated into 3 Projects:
1- Application layer (.Net Core Web API project). 
2- Domain layer (Class library). 
3- Infrastructure layer (Class library). 

Entity framework Core is used as an ORM using Code-First approach and ADO.NET with Microsoft SQL Database.

For the Soap Services I Used SoapCore Library.


I added a global exception handler, and I used fluent validation to validate models.
